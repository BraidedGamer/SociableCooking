#SociableCooking
----------------
SociableCooking is a web application that allows all registered users to post and comment on recipes.

SociableCooking is a way to open your kitchen to creative and innovative new cooking methods and recipes. After
registering with the site feel to post recipes with weird and akward directions. I'll try and go through and weed out
all bull-shit recipes. Mainly because, after I hit a certain number of recipes in the database I plan to start selling
recipe books with recipes from the site and I'll probably create a new database table for each year so that I can keep
the hard copy book recipes straight.

* I intend to work on evolving this site beyond what it is now by implementing ajax for a more dynamic experience

* I'll eventually be going through and commenting out all the code for easier understanding of the code

* I'll be keeping a close eye on the sociable.net domain and if it ever becomes available I'll switch sociablecooking
to sociable.net and make it a fully-fledged social network.
