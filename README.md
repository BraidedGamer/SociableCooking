#SociableCooking

[SociableCooking](http://www.theodorepr.com/recipe_center) is a web application that allows all registered users to post and comment on recipes.

SociableCooking is a way to open your kitchen to creative and innovative new cooking methods and recipes. After
registering with the site feel to post recipes with weird and akward directions. I'll try and go through and weed out
all bull-shit recipes. Mainly because, after I hit a certain number of recipes in the database I plan to start selling
recipe books with recipes from the site and I'll probably add a date stamp to the recipes table in order to properly know what year recipes are submitted. Though I will never sell any information submitted into the website. Please bear in mind that I am one lone developer and still learning.

* [ ] I intend to work on evolving this site beyond what it is now by implementing ajax for a more dynamic experience

* [ ] I'll eventually be going through and commenting out all the code for easier understanding of the code

* [ ] Enhanced Encryption for password with a salted hash

* [ ] Forgotten Password Reset

* [ ] I'll add a little javascipt/json/jquery or whatever I feel will work with my plans for the website

* [ ] I'll add a function to grab your current ip address and look-up your current location when commenting,
posting, or editing recipes.

* [ ] I'll add a status function and and a more advanced profile page.

* [x] Spiced-UP Functionality

* [ ] Switch the catalog code to Classes

* [ ] Fitration System

* [x] Categorical System

* [x] Rework Navigation System

* [ ] Profile System

* [ ] Life Tip System

* [ ] Add a little perl flare to the site, greeting script

* [ ] Add a datestamp key value to the recipes table

* [ ] Restructure site files into folders similar to my portfolio site

* [ ] Create a PDO Database connection with a framework

*After all that I'll have earned a good break. Question is will I want to take a break?*
